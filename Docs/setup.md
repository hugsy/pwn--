# Setup


## Windows

MSVC redist for [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) / [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) / [ARM64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe)


## Linux

  - None (AFAIK)

_Note_ Linux support is currently on hold as too many modern features of C++20/23 that are being used for practice on this project are not entirely (or at all) supported. We'll continue to follow improvements for Linux compilers (both [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html) and [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html)) to make them work as compilers support the features. Currently GCC and clang compilers mark C++20 support as experimental.
