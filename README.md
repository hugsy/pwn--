## Quick start

### Template

Use Git to clone the template in [`hugsy/template-pwn`](https://github.com/hugsy/pwn--template)

```console
git clone https://github.com/hugsy/pwn--template MyProject
```

### CMake

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    pwn++
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/hugsy/pwn--.git
    GIT_TAG main # or whatever other tag or use releases (URL)
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(pwn++)
```

## What is it?

A poor rewrite of my [PwnLib](https://github.com/hugsy/pwnlib) DLL in modern C++, battery-included pwn kit for Windows (and a bit for Linux).

## Why?

Because:
  - I wanted a quick way to bootstrap my low-level experiments
  - it's unacceptable to struggle to disassemble code, to cross-compile your exploit or simply to have `hexdump`-like function
  - only C/C++ provides the real right way to write assembly code
  - modern C++ allows to do crazy useful offsec stuff, completely underused
  - I like writing code

The idea is to provide in C on Windows the same kind of functionalities than [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) does in Python on Linux. It's also a toy library meant for exploring Windows in a more friendly way. So if you're looking for years of poorly written C++ tangled with performant inefficient ways to experiment low-level, go no further friend this library is for you.

_Note_: the original `PwnLib` was written around Windows 7 for feature testing. This is 100% Windows 10/11 focused, so expect things to go wrong if you use any other Windows version. Some stuff may also go wrong in x86. Better use 64. It's not a bug but a design choice ðŸ˜‹
