A rewrite of my [PwnLib](https://github.com/hugsy/pwnlib) DLL in modern C++, battery-included pwn kit for Windows (and a bit for Linux).

The idea is to provide in C on Windows the same kind of functionalities than [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) does in Python on Linux.
It's also a toy library meant for exploring Windows in a more friendly way. So if you're looking for years of poorly written C/C++ tangled with performant
inefficient ways to explore Windows at low-level, go no further friend this library is for you.

_Note_: the original `PwnLib` was written around Windows 7 for feature testing. This is 100% Windows 10/11 focused, so expect things to go wrong if you use any other Windows version. Some stuff may also go wrong in x86. Better use 64. It's not a bug but a design choice ðŸ˜‹
