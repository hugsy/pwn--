# Setup

## Windows

 - x86 → [MSVC 16+ x86 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
 - x64 → [MSVC 16+ x64 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)


## Linux

  - None (AFAIK)

_Note_ Support of C++20/23 on Linux compilers (both [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html) and [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html)) is way incomplete so chances are it won't compile at all until the features I'm using are fully supported. Both compilers mark C++20 support as experimental.
